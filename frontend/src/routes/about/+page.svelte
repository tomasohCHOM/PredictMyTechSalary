	<p>
		<b><i>Predict My Tech Salary</i></b> focuses on the impact that demographic data has on the
		compensation of employees in the technical industry. The goal of this project is to develop a
		model that predicts a yearly salary given arbitrary parameters, such as ethnicity, gender, age,
		education level, and accessibility. This data science project is a part of the
		<b>Project ACCESS</b> Summer 2024 Research Program with the overarching goal of raising awareness
		of emerging social justice issues in STEM.
	</p>

	<h2>Exploring data sets</h2>

	<p>
		We began by first exploring which data set to use for our model. We wanted the data to include
		information such as the total yearly compensation for a tech employee and demographic data about
		those individuals. For our purposes, the <b>Stack Overflow 2022 Developer Survey </b> was the most
		suitable as it contained information about total converted compensation for developers around the
		world, including self-reported demographic data, such as gender, age, and ethnicity.
	</p>

	<h2>Building the model</h2>

	<h2>The website</h2>

	<p>
		We wanted the user to easily interact with our model, and our best idea was to create a web user
		interface with user input and a form submission button. For our purposes, we built this web
		application using <b>SvelteKit</b> and <b>FastAPI</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		SvelteKit is a framework for building robust and performant web applications using Svelte, the
		UI component framework that SvelteKit is built on top of. It supports routing (creating multiple
		pages in the same application; how you can see this <code>/about</code> page), server-side rendering,
		and building custom APIs. On the other hand, FastAPI is a fast, modern framework for building APIs
		in Python. We decided to use these technologies because they made it easy to implement our application
		features without distracting too much from the project's actual goal; developing the model.
	</p>
	<p>
		The client-server interaction works like this: the SvelteKit application has the form element
		that, when the user fills in the information and presses the "Calculate!" button, will create a
		request to the API endpoint (the FastAPI application). If all goes well, the endpoint will
		respond with the predicted salary and render it in the website.
	</p>

	<p>
		Thankfully, this is quite a standard client-server interaction, so we did not encounter many
		issues implementing this part of the project.
	</p>

	<h2>Challenges with building the model</h2>

	<p>We had a shiton of problems.</p>
