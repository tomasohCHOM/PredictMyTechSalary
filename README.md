# PredictMyTechSalary

Predict My Tech Salary is a data science project that focuses on the impact that demographic data 
has on the compensation of employees in the technical industry. The goal of this project is to develop 
a model that predicts a yearly salary given arbitrary parameters, such as ethnicity, gender, age, education 
level, and accessibility. This data science project is a part of the Project ACCESS Summer 2024 Research 
Program with the overarching goal of raising awareness of emerging social justice issues in STEM.

for instructions on how to set up both parts of the application.
